      "content": "This document provides a general introduction to workflows, including the reasons why organizations adopt workflow processes, when and when not to use workflows, and a few Mendix workflow business use cases. For instructions on how to perform Mendix workflow basic functions, see Performing Workflow Basic Functions.\n\nWorkflow is a visual language that allows you to build extendable processes. In Mendix Studio Pro, it is fully integrated with other visual editors, such as the microflow editor and page editor. Implementing workflow processes is beneficial for organizations that would like to enhance operational efficiency, ensure compliance with regulations, and mitigate risks.\n\nBelow are the key reasons why organizations adopt workflow processes:\n\nCompliance management:\n\nEnsuring adherence to local rules, regulations, and laws.\nHelping to document any available data, including actions taken and decisions made. This helps to provide a clear audit trail.\n\n\n\nPerformance improvement:\n\nImproving key performance indicators (KPIs) by identifying and addressing bottlenecks.\nReducing the time to complete tasks and minimizing overdue penalties.\nEnhancing the quality and efficiency of operations, which improves work satisfaction.\n\n\n\nRisk reduction:\n\nPreventing overdue penalties by streamlining processes.\nAnticipating potential bottlenecks that could impact KPIs or introduce additional risks.\nAvoiding overwork and stress among users and teams, thus maintaining compliance and productivity.\n\nFor more information on when and when not to use workflows, see the When to Use Workflows? and When Not to Use Workflows sections below.\n\nFor information on Mendix workflow use cases, see the Mendix Workflow Use Cases section below.",

      "content": "Automating a process with workflows is the most effective when the process meets specific criteria, ensuring smooth execution and optimization.\n\nBelow are the criteria that a process should meet to be successfully implemented with workflows:\n\nWell-defined and known – the process is clearly understood and documented.\nRepeatable nature – the process involves tasks that are performed regularly or in a cyclical manner.\nHigh frequency of execution – the process occurs frequently, requiring consistent handling.\nInvolvement of multiple participants – the process requires collaboration among different individuals or departments.\nCombination of human and automated tasks – the process involves a mix of activities that can be performed both by humans and automated systems.\nStability – the process remains relatively unchanged over time, with minimal variations.\nSeries of activities – it comprises a sequence of interconnected steps or actions.\nLonger duration – the process spans a significant period, ranging from hours to months.",

It might be beneficial to consider alternative approaches, such as utilizing multiple smaller workflows that are loosely coupled with other logic.",

With Mendix, you can keep workflows focused on representing your business processes, while using the other logic (such as microflows and nanoflows) for more technical implementations.\n\nThe table below presents a few use cases that are a good fit for Mendix workflows:\n\nUse case\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSupply chain management in regulated industries\nCompanies in highly regulated process industries can use Mendix workflows to manage supply chain changes, such as changes in packaging, weight, and other conditions. Mendix workflows validate and assess the impact of these changes at each stage, ensuring smooth adaptation to evolving requirements.\n\n\nMigration from dedicated BPM platforms\nCustomers can transition from dedicated BPM platforms to Mendix to reduce cost, simplify maintenance, enhance user experience, and accelerate time-to-value.\n\n\nMaintenance plan approval\nFor customers who have migrated their industrial equipment maintenance plans from spreadsheets to Mendix, workflows provide a structured review and approval process for changes of predefined maintenance plans.\n\n\nDynamic business process support for a new product launch\nFor companies needing rapid application development to support end-to-end business processes for new product launches, Mendix workflows can be integrated for the subsequent legal and financial review and approval.\n\n\nAutomated customer onboarding process\nOrganizations that need to streamline customer onboarding can use Mendix workflows to automate the process across multiple systems and involve user intervention for invalid situations. This ensures a smooth onboarding experience.\n\nFor more information on a concrete use case, see Configuring a Workflow in Studio Pro for the Employee Onboarding Process.",
